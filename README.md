* [*Unified Image Reconstruction Description*](https://github.com/JMMC-OpenDev/OI-Imaging-JRA/blob/gh-pages/unified_desc.pdf) exploits the *inverse problem* framework to present the general principles of image reconstruction from interferometric data.
* [*Interface to Image Reconstruction*](https://github.com/JMMC-OpenDev/OI-Imaging-JRA/blob/gh-pages/OI-Interface.pdf) is a draft document giving the specifications for a graphical user interface to control image reconstruction algorithms.
* Directory [`doc`](./doc) contains the sources of the various documents.
